### **Project Structure**
For the BackEnd structure of this project, please refer to this [document](BACKEND_DOC.md).



### **Linting**
Linting is the automated checking of a source code for programmatic and stylistic errors. This is done by using a lint tool (otherwise known as linter). A lint tool is a basic static code analyzer. Linting is important to reduce errors and improve the overall quality of our code.

For the backend part of this project, the Google code style is used with some minor modifications. A code style is set of conventions (sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent style.


### **Commit Guide**
This plugin uses Commitlint to ensure commits messages follow a particular convention using the conventional config. If you're totally new to this convention, that's totally fine.
